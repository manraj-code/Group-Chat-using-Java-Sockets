Project is based Java-Socket TCP. In which i have made 3 files Server, Client, ClientHandler.
Client class will create clients and Server class will simple accept the clients and crate different Threads for the same.
To handle this Threads there is a ClientHandler class which will do the work of broadcasting the message from one person to other all.
